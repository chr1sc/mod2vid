# mod2vid

This bash script turns tracker modules into music videos - not the fancy ones with touching landscapes and action scenes - just a pattern view before a background image or video and a frequency analyzer at the bottom.

## Who Is This Script For

If you're not a tracker musician or collector this one's probably not for you.

## Installation Guide


## How to Use It

The easiest way to invoke the program and create a video is by typing

```
$ mod2vid module_name.ext
```

This will start a number of programs. First, the module will be rendered as wav
